                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The Academy has revealed the nominations for the 98th Academy Awards, and this year's list has sparked intense debate thanks to a mix of historic achievements, unexpected snubs and headline-making surprises.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The biggest headline of the morning belonged to Sinners, which made Oscars history by earning a record-breaking 16 nominations, surpassing longtime record holders Titanic and La La Land.</p>

                        <div class="mb-4 text-center">
                            <img src="../images/articles/article11_2.webp" alt="Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba in Wicked For Good" class="img-fluid rounded shadow w-100">

                        </div>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">However, the celebration was tempered by one of the most shocking omissions of the year: Wicked: For Good. Despite its predecessor earning 10 nominations in 2025 and strong momentum throughout awards season, the sequel failed to secure a single nod.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Major Snub: Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Costars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo were both excluded from the acting categories despite being nominated the previous year. Grande, in particular, was considered a strong contender after receiving multiple precursor nominations, making her absence especially surprising.</p>

                        <div class="mb-4 text-center">
                            <img src="../images/articles/article11_3.webp" alt="The Smashing Machine" class="img-fluid rounded shadow w-100">
                            <div class="text-muted small mt-2">The Smashing Machine.</div>
                        </div>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Snub: Paul Mescal</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Paul Mescal was widely expected to receive his second Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a grieving William Shakespeare in Hamnet. After dominating the awards circuit, his omission from the Best Actor lineup stunned industry watchers.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Snub: Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Despite critical praise and Golden Globe nominations, Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt were left out of the Oscars race for their performances in The Smashing Machine, marking a disappointing awards season for the MMA biopic.</p>

                        <div class="mb-4 text-center">
                            <img src="../images/articles/article11_4.webp" alt="George Clooney is Jay Kelly" class="img-fluid rounded shadow w-100">

                        </div>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Snub: George Clooney and Adam Sandler</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Noah Baumbach's Jay Kelly failed to gain traction with Academy voters. Expected acting contenders George Clooney and Adam Sandler walked away without nominations after similar losses at other major awards shows.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Surprise: Kate Hudson</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">One of the day's brightest moments came from Kate Hudson, who earned her second Oscar nomination for her performance in Song Sung Blue. The recognition marks a career milestone, 25 years after her first nomination for Almost Famous.</p>

                        <div class="mb-4 text-center">

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Snub: Chase Infiniti</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Although One Battle After Another dominated the nominations overall, breakout star Chase Infiniti was notably absent from the Best Actress category despite earning nominations earlier in the season.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Surprise: Delroy Lindo</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Delroy Lindo earned his first-ever Oscar nomination for Sinners, a welcome surprise after being overlooked by the Golden Globes and Critics' Choice Awards. His nomination further cemented the film's historic morning.</p>

                        <div class="mb-4 text-center">
                            <img src="../images/articles/article11_6.webp" alt="Delroy Lindo in Sinners" class="img-fluid rounded shadow w-100">

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">With passions running high and debates already raging, the 2026 Oscar nominations have set the stage for a dramatic awards season leading up to the ceremony on March 15.</p>
