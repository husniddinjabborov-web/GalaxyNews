                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Jaime King is getting divorced from her second husband, Austin Sosa, just months after the couple publicly announced their engagement.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Court documents show that Sosa filed for divorce on Thursday, Jan. 22, marking the end of the couple's brief marriage.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">It is unclear when King and Sosa officially married, as the pair kept their wedding private prior to the divorce filing.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The couple confirmed their engagement in July 2025, with King expressing gratitude for the support she received at the time.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She was especially happy to share the milestone with her children and emphasized that her sons remain her top priority.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Sources previously noted that King had grown close to Sosa's family and had been staying with his parents after moving out of her Los Angeles apartment earlier in 2025.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">King shares two sons, James, 12, and Leo, 10, with her ex-husband Kyle Newman.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She briefly discussed her engagement in a September podcast appearance, revealing that she and Sosa met through mutual friends.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">King was previously married to Newman from 2007 until their separation in 2020. Their divorce was finalized in 2023.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">In 2025, Newman was granted sole physical custody of their sons, while both parents continue to share legal custody.</p>
