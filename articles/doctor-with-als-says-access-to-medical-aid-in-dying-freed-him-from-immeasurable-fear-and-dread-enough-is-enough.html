                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">A New York City doctor living with ALS says having access to medical aid in dying has given him peace and freedom from what he describes as immeasurable fear and dread.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Jeremy Boal, chief clinical officer for Mount Sinai Health System, was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in August 2023 after experiencing unexplained leg spasms that worsened over time.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Following neurological exams and multiple MRIs, Boal recalled the devastating moment his doctor delivered the diagnosis, describing it as hearing a death sentence that would involve prolonged suffering.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare degenerative condition that causes progressive muscle paralysis, eventually affecting a person's ability to speak, eat, walk, and breathe independently.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Boal said his greatest fear was not death itself, but the idea of becoming trapped inside a body that could no longer move or communicate, while remaining mentally aware.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">For months after his diagnosis, he described living in a constant state of panic and dread, haunted by visions of a prolonged and painful death caused by ALS.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Over time, however, Boal said joy slowly returned to his life through therapy, support from loved ones, and the knowledge that he would have the option of medical aid in dying.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Medical aid in dying allows terminally ill patients who meet strict criteria to receive a prescription for medication they can choose to take to end their lives, a process distinct from euthanasia.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Several U.S. states have already authorized medical aid in dying, and New York is expected to join the list after Governor Kathy Hochul announced plans to sign legislation allowing the practice.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Boal said knowing he will be able to decide when his suffering becomes unbearable has allowed him to focus on living fully rather than fearing the future.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">He shared that when the law takes effect, he hopes to spend his final moments outdoors with his wife and daughters, surrounded by nature and the life he cherishes.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Today, Boal says he meditates, exercises carefully, advocates for patient choice, and savors everyday experiences that once felt overshadowed by fear.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">He believes that access to medical aid in dying has restored his sense of control and allowed him to live more vibrantly in the time he has left.</p>
