                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">A Nevada mother searching for her daughter made a heartbreaking discovery after tracking her phone's location and seeing it ping at the Clark County Coroner's Office in Las Vegas.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Cheri Brown had been trying to reach her daughter, Amber Brown, for hours when the phone location revealed the devastating truth on June 19.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Amber Brown, a 33-year-old nurse, was fatally struck by a vehicle while crossing the street in Las Vegas around 5 p.m. that day.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She was transported to a hospital following the collision but later died from her injuries.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Police arrested 37-year-old Angel Franco Merida at the scene in connection with the fatal incident.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">A 14-year-old passenger who was inside the vehicle involved in the collision was rescued without injury.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Amber's identity was later confirmed through coroner records and social media posts shared by her mother.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Cheri Brown described the moment she learned of her daughter's death as overwhelming and said she completely broke down.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Adding to her grief is the possibility that the suspect may never face trial for the alleged actions.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">After initially appearing before a judge and posting bond, Merida was later taken into custody by immigration authorities.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Court records indicate that he was deported to Guatemala, raising concerns that he may not be brought back to face charges.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Cheri expressed deep frustration, saying she believes her daughter deserves justice regardless of the suspect's immigration status.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She emphasized that fleeing the country should not allow someone to escape responsibility for a life lost.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The case has left Amber's family mourning both her death and the uncertainty surrounding accountability.</p>
