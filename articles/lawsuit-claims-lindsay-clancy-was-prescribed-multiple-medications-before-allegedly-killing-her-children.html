                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">New court documents detail allegations surrounding the medical treatment Lindsay Clancy received in the months before the deaths of her three children.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The information is outlined in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by her husband, Patrick Clancy, against several medical providers.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the estates of the couple's three children: five-year-old Cora, three-year-old Dawson, and eight-month-old Callan.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">According to the filing, Lindsay Clancy was prescribed at least nine medications in the months leading up to the incident.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Eight of those medications were allegedly prescribed within a three-week period between mid-November and early December of 2022.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Patrick Clancy stated that his wife was seeking help for anxiety following the birth of their third child.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The lawsuit claims that her mental condition deteriorated significantly during this time.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Medical records cited in the filing allege that Lindsay began hearing a voice that instructed her to harm herself and her children.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The voice allegedly told her that it was her last chance and that her children needed to go with her.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Patrick Clancy claims that his wife struggled with returning to work after the births of their first two children, but that her condition worsened after the third.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She eventually sought psychiatric care and was first prescribed sertraline, commonly known as Zoloft.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">According to the complaint, she delayed taking the medication and later reported severe side effects including insomnia and increased anxiety.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">After experiencing prolonged sleep deprivation, she went to the emergency room and was prescribed additional medication.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Over the following weeks, she was prescribed several other medications, including antidepressants, sleep aids, anti-anxiety drugs, and mood stabilizers.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The lawsuit accuses healthcare providers of prescribing powerful medications without properly monitoring her reaction to them.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Patrick Clancy alleges that had proper care been provided, his children would still be alive.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">One of the medical providers named in the lawsuit has stated that it cannot comment on the allegations due to ongoing litigation.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Lindsay Clancy is scheduled to go on trial later this year.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Her defense team has indicated plans to pursue an insanity defense, citing postpartum psychosis.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">According to court filings, the incident occurred after Patrick Clancy briefly left the home to pick up dinner.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">When he returned, he discovered that his wife had jumped from a second-story window.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Emergency responders later found the couple's three children had been strangled.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The two older children were pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The youngest child died several days later from his injuries.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Patrick Clancy has publicly stated that he forgives his wife and has encouraged others to do the same.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Prosecutors, however, argue that the acts were planned and deliberate.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The trial is currently scheduled to begin in July.</p>
