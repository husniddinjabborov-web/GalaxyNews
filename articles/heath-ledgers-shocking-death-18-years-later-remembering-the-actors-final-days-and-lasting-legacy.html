                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Heath Ledger's career was at a high point when he died, with memorable performances ranging from the rom-com '10 Things I Hate About You' to the drama 'Brokeback Mountain'. His portrayal of The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' earned him a posthumous Academy Award.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Ledger was pronounced dead at 3:36 p.m. on Jan. 22, 2008, in his New York apartment. The cause of death was later ruled an accidental overdose from the combined effects of prescription medications including oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam, and doxylamine.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Ledger had been struggling physically and emotionally, dealing with a lingering illness and the pressures of work and personal life, according to friends and colleagues. He had expressed exhaustion and unhappiness before his death.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">In the days before his death, Ledger spoke with his sister Kate and his friend Matt Amato. These conversations were described as lighthearted and affectionate, with no indication of the tragedy to come.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Ledger was living in New York while filming 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'. On the morning of Jan. 22, 2008, his housekeeper and masseuse found him unresponsive, leading to the arrival of paramedics who pronounced him dead.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Ledger's role as The Joker had a profound impact on him off-screen. He isolated himself, kept journals in character, and slept only a few hours per night while preparing for the role, describing the character as a 'psychopathic, mass-murdering, schizophrenic clown'.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Public reaction to Ledger's death was immediate and widespread. Fans gathered outside his Manhattan apartment and the Brooklyn home he had shared with Michelle Williams. Hollywood peers, including Gary Oldman and Daniel Day-Lewis, expressed admiration and grief.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Michelle Williams, Ledger's former partner and mother of his daughter Matilda, spoke publicly about her heartbreak, emphasizing Ledger's enduring presence in their daughter's life.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Ledger is remembered for his versatile talent and the depth he brought to every role, from teen comedies to dramatic films. He continues to inspire actors and audiences alike through his performances, his daughter Matilda, and the Australians in Film Heath Ledger Scholarship, which supports Australian actors transitioning to Hollywood.</p>
