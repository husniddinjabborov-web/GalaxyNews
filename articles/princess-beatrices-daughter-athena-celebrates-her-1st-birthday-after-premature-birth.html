                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Princess Beatrice is celebrating a special milestone as her daughter Athena Elizabeth Rose Mapelli Mozzi turns 1 on Jan. 22.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Athena is the youngest child of Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, and she was born prematurely in 2025, several weeks earlier than her expected due date.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Buckingham Palace had originally announced that the baby was due in early spring, but Athena arrived sooner than expected, something Beatrice later reflected on in a rare personal essay.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">In the essay, Beatrice described the uncertainty and fear that comes with welcoming a premature baby, writing about the emotional challenges and the lack of control parents feel in such moments.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She shared that Athena arrived healthy despite being tiny, and it took weeks for the family to fully process the relief and reality of life with their newborn.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Following Athena's birth, Beatrice thanked her medical team at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and became a patron of Borne, a British medical research charity focused on preventing premature birth.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The couple made their first major public appearance after Athena's birth at Borne's Wonderland Gala, and later visited the charity's research laboratories to support its work.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Athena's middle name, Elizabeth, honors the late Queen Elizabeth II, continuing a family naming tradition and tribute.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Beatrice and Edoardo are also parents to daughter Sienna and Edoardo's son Christopher from a previous relationship, making Athena's arrival a special moment for their blended family of five.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The family made a rare public appearance together at the London homecoming parade celebrating England's women's national football team, which marked Athena's first public outing.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Athena was christened in a private ceremony at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in December, attended quietly by her grandparents Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">As Athena celebrates her first birthday, the royal family marks a joyful milestone following a year that began with uncertainty but ended with happiness and growing family memories.</p>
