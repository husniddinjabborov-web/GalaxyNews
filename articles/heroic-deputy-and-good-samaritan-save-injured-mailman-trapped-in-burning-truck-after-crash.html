                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">A frightening crash in Parkland, Washington, quickly escalated into a life-or-death situation when a USPS truck began filling with smoke after colliding with a sedan.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The accident happened on January 8 along Park Avenue South, leaving the mail truck driver injured and trapped inside his vehicle as smoke thickened by the second.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">As traffic slowed and drivers looked on, one woman, Stephanie Burkhart Mabee, immediately sensed the danger and pulled over without hesitation.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Mabee could see heavy smoke pouring from the truck and realized the driver inside was unable to escape on his own.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Acting purely on instinct, she rushed back to her car and grabbed emergency tools she carried, including a hammer, a seat belt cutter and a fire extinguisher.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Although flames had not yet fully erupted, Mabee later said it was clear the truck was moments away from catching fire.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Using the hammer, she broke the door handle so the door could slide open and carefully cut the driver's seat belt to free him from the seat.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">As she worked to pull the injured man out, a deputy arrived at the scene and immediately joined the rescue effort.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Body camera footage later released showed thick smoke surrounding the vehicle as the two worked together under intense pressure.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">They attempted to put out the fire using extinguishers, but the flames continued to grow, forcing them to prioritize moving the driver farther away.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Together, they dragged the mailman to a safer distance just as the situation became increasingly dangerous.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Authorities later confirmed that both the mail truck driver and a passenger from the sedan were taken to local hospitals in serious condition.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Mabee reflected on the rescue by saying she hoped others would respond the same way in emergencies, rather than watching from their cars.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She explained that fear never crossed her mind, as her focus was entirely on getting the injured man out alive.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Local officials publicly praised Mabee's courage, crediting her quick response with preventing a far worse outcome.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">They also highlighted the importance of teamwork between civilians and law enforcement during critical moments.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The dramatic rescue stands as a powerful reminder that everyday people can become heroes when they choose to act.</p>
