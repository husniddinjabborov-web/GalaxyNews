                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">New details surrounding the death of Renee Nicole Good are emerging as her family releases findings from an independent autopsy, shedding further light on the fatal shooting that has sparked national outrage and ongoing protests in Minneapolis.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was found unresponsive inside her car on the morning of Jan. 7 after a confrontation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross. She had just dropped her 6-year-old child off at school before the deadly encounter.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">According to a Minneapolis police and fire department incident report obtained by PEOPLE, Good was discovered around 9:42 a.m. local time with blood on her face and torso while seated in her maroon Honda Pilot.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The Chicago-based law firm Romanucci & Blandin, which represents Good's family and previously secured a $27 million settlement for George Floyd's family, commissioned the independent autopsy as part of its private investigation into the killing.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The preliminary findings, conducted by a highly credentialed medical pathologist, identified three clear gunshot wound paths and a fourth graze wound consistent with a firearm injury.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">According to the report, one bullet struck Good's left forearm, causing soft tissue hemorrhage. A second traveled through her right breast without damaging major organs. The fatal wound entered near her left temple and exited the right side of her head.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The autopsy concluded that the wounds to the breast and forearm were not immediately life-threatening. The head wound was determined to be the cause of death.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office has not yet released its official autopsy results to the family or their legal team.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Attorney Antonio M. Romanucci said the decision to publicly release the findings reflects the family's commitment to transparency and accountability as the investigation continues.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Jonathan Ross, who joined ICE in 2015 and later served as a firearms instructor and member of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, has not been charged with a crime. Federal authorities say the FBI is handling the investigation.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Homeland Security confirmed Ross was taken to the hospital following the shooting with internal injuries, but declined to provide further details. Minnesota officials have called for a fair and transparent investigation.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Despite federal claims labeling Good as a threat, her family strongly disputes that narrative, describing her as a loving mother, devoted partner, and a source of light and optimism to those around her.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">As protests, vigils, and political debate continue, Good's partner Becca Good says she is focused on raising their child and honoring Renee's belief in a better future.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Good's family insists that her death will not fade quietly and that they will continue pursuing the truth about what happened on Jan. 7.</p>
