                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">For most of her childhood and teenage years, Melanie Manderino lived in near silence, unable to speak in public settings despite desperately wanting to express herself.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Now 18 years old, Melanie has begun sharing her story after struggling with selective mutism, a severe anxiety disorder that made speaking in social situations feel physically impossible.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Although she was capable of talking, every attempt to speak outside her home felt overwhelming, as if her voice were being blocked by fear.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">At school, Melanie was completely silent, spending years unable to participate in class discussions or even say a few words to classmates.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She recalls feeling trapped inside her own body, with thoughts and personality locked away behind anxiety she didn't yet understand.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Watching other children speak freely only deepened her confusion, as she assumed they were simply better at communication rather than realizing she was experiencing a mental health condition.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Selective mutism often begins in childhood and is considered rare, affecting less than one percent of the population, yet its impact can be life-altering.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">For Melanie, even thinking about speaking triggered physical symptoms, including nausea, shaking and a racing heart.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She would rehearse sentences repeatedly in her mind, knowing exactly what she wanted to say but never being able to bring the words out.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">As a result, she often felt isolated, sitting quietly beside peers and struggling to form friendships.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Though she occasionally managed to say a few words as she grew older, most interactions remained painfully limited.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">By the time she was 16, the emotional toll of silence had led her to feel deeply depressed and disconnected from the world around her.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">At that low point, Melanie realized something needed to change and turned to faith, asking for strength and help to face her fear.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She remembers attending an event with one simple goal in mind — to say hello to just one person.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">When someone approached her and greeted her first, she found the courage to quietly say hello back, a moment that felt monumental.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">That small exchange marked the beginning of a slow and difficult journey toward finding her voice.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Progress didn't come easily, but Melanie began allowing herself to speak a few words at a time, gradually building confidence.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">During her junior year of high school, forming a close friendship helped her learn communication skills she had never had the chance to develop.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Encouraged by her growth, Melanie decided to share her experience online, hoping to raise awareness about selective mutism.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Her video quickly went viral, reaching millions and connecting her with others who saw their own struggles reflected in her story.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Messages from viewers, especially younger students dealing with the same condition, reinforced her belief that sharing her story mattered.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Today, Melanie continues to work through her anxiety, acknowledging that selective mutism is still part of her life.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">However, she now knows that silence does not define her future and that growth is possible, even if it comes slowly.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">By speaking out, she hopes others facing similar challenges will realize they are not alone and that there is hope beyond fear.</p>
