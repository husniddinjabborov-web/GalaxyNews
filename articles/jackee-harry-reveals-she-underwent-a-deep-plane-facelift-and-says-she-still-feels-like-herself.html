                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Jackée Harry has opened up about undergoing a deep-plane facelift and how the experience has impacted her sense of self.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The 69-year-old actress revealed that she had the cosmetic procedure done in the fall of 2025 after considering it for nearly two years.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She explained that she wanted to address loose skin and felt ready to take the step after thinking carefully about it for a long time.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Harry shared that she was very clear about what she wanted from the surgery and described her goal as wanting her skin to feel lifted and refreshed.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Her surgeon described the deep-plane facelift as a procedure that resets facial tissues to their earlier position and noted that it can take several hours to complete.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The actress said she had ongoing conversations with her doctor over the years before finally deciding to move forward.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Reflecting on her younger self, Harry said she always felt confident and glamorous and hoped to reconnect with that feeling.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She also revealed that she looked to other celebrities for inspiration while considering the procedure.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Harry recalled advice she once received to take small steps when it comes to cosmetic work, rather than waiting too long.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Despite her excitement, she admitted she had fears about pain and worried about whether the surgery would change her appearance too much.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She also shared that her boyfriend encouraged her to embrace her natural beauty and reassured her that she did not need the procedure.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, Harry decided to move forward after realizing how strongly she wanted it.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Following the healing process, she said the procedure helped her feel more like herself.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Harry openly discussed experiencing body dysmorphia and explained that the facelift helped her reconnect with her identity.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She emphasized that she has no issues with aging and does not feel ashamed of her age.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">According to Harry, the procedure did not change who she is but instead enhanced how she feels about herself.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She also acknowledged that cosmetic procedures can become addictive and said she remains cautious about taking things further.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Before the surgery, she worried about whether she would still look like herself afterward.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">After seeing the results, she said she felt relieved and confident that she was still recognizably herself.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Looking ahead, Harry shared that she is excited for the moment when she can fully step back into glamorous public appearances.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She said one of the moments she is most looking forward to is walking down the aisle alongside her boyfriend.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Harry has played Paulina Price on Days of Our Lives since 2021 and continues to stay active in her career.</p>
