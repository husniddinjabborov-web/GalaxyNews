                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Bethenny Frankel revealed that she has been diagnosed with stage 2 chronic kidney disease.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">The reality TV alum shared the news in a January 22 video, explaining that she wanted to raise awareness and encourage others to take precautions with their own health.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She said she has been proactive about regular medical testing, including bloodwork and bone density scans, when repeated results showed her kidney function levels were low.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">After several abnormal test results, Frankel was referred to a kidney specialist, despite initially feeling hesitant about attending the appointment.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">During the visit, she was informed that she has stage 2 chronic kidney disease, which she said may be linked to an autoimmune condition or a severe allergic reaction she experienced years ago.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Stage 2 kidney disease is considered a mild loss of kidney function and can often be managed through monitoring and lifestyle changes.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Frankel shared that the condition may explain why she has experienced recurrent infections in the past.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Her doctor advised her to stay well hydrated, recommending a significant increase in daily water intake.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She admitted that drinking enough water has always been a challenge for her, despite understanding its importance.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Frankel was also instructed to avoid certain medications and supplements that could negatively impact kidney health.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">This diagnosis follows a series of health challenges, including long COVID and an autoimmune disorder she was diagnosed with in 2023.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this year, she also dealt with a bacterial infection while on vacation.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Frankel said she decided to speak publicly about her condition to encourage others to stay on top of their medical appointments and bloodwork.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She emphasized the importance of follow-up testing, noting that patterns in results can reveal underlying health issues.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Frankel added that while she is still learning about her condition, she hopes sharing her experience will help others take their health seriously.</p>
