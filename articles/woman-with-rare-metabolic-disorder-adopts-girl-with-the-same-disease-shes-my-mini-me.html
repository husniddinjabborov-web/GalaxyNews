                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Growing up with a rare genetic disorder, Pam Kowalczyk often felt isolated and misunderstood, struggling with a condition that few people around her truly understood.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Phenylketonuria, known as PKU, affects how the body processes protein and requires constant monitoring, strict dietary limits and lifelong medical management.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Pam was diagnosed at birth and immediately placed on a carefully controlled low-protein diet, which allowed her to protect her cognitive development and live a full, independent life.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">As she grew older, doctors warned Pam that pregnancy could pose serious risks because uncontrolled PKU during pregnancy can severely harm a developing baby.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Faced with those realities, Pam made the difficult but determined decision that adoption would be the safest and most responsible way for her to become a parent.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Rather than shy away from challenges, she felt drawn to adopting a child with PKU or another disability she knew she could understand and support.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">In 2016, while attending a PKU conference, Pam learned about children around the world waiting for adoption who shared her condition.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">When she saw a photo of Kelsey, a young girl living with PKU, Pam felt an instant emotional connection and knew she had found her daughter.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Kelsey had been abandoned as a baby, with a note explaining that she had PKU and needed someone who could care for her medical needs.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Pam trusted her experience and medical knowledge and moved forward with the adoption process, believing she could give Kelsey the life she deserved.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">They met for the first time on July 31, 2017, the day the adoption was finalized, and Pam immediately sensed something was wrong.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Kelsey struggled to walk, was completely non-verbal and showed signs of significant developmental delays that concerned Pam deeply.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Medical evaluations later confirmed that Kelsey had suffered irreversible brain damage due to untreated PKU during infancy.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Although Kelsey's form of PKU is genetically milder than Pam's, the lack of early treatment drastically changed the course of her development.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Today, Kelsey is 12 years old, but cognitively functions closer to a much younger child and requires daily support.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She uses assistive communication devices, attends speech and occupational therapy, and has learned sign language to help express herself.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Pam manages behavioral challenges with patience, understanding that frustration often comes from Kelsey's difficulty communicating her needs.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Together, mother and daughter closely monitor their blood levels and carefully track everything they eat to keep their condition under control.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Pam follows an extremely restrictive diet, often relying on medical formula and eating very little solid food throughout the day.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Kelsey, whose condition allows for more flexibility, enjoys a wider range of carefully selected foods.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Despite the daily challenges, their shared condition has created a deep bond built on empathy, strength and mutual understanding.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Medical experts say that growing up with a parent who shares the same condition provides Kelsey with an invaluable built-in support system.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">Pam believes their journey together proves that shared hardship can also create powerful connection and resilience.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 fs-5 text-dark lh-lg" style="text-align: justify;">She often reminds her daughter that no matter how difficult life becomes, they are capable of facing it together.</p>
